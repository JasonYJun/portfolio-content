            <p>
                My name is Jason, a photographer, filmmaker, YouTube creator and entrepreneur based in Ann Arbor. I use my platforms to inspire and help people pursue their passions behind the lens. In 2019 I was named Breakout YouTuber of the Year at the Shorty Awards and in 2020 received a Streamy for Cinematographer of the Year. My work can be found in a number of outlets but a notable personal achievement for me was having my work featured on two special collection coins issued by the Royal Canadian Mint.

                Photography is a hobby that you can make improvements quickly and see your progress easily. If you line up your photos next to each other from month to month, you will see those changes. In one year, those differences will be significant. Not only will you see how much better you are, seeing some of your favorites each month will give you that extra bit of motivation to keep clicking away.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of all the things I’ve listed above, photography can bring you so much joy. In the midst of a hectic day, there is just something satisfying about slowing down and intentionally focusing on what is in front of you. I feel like I’m filling up my own gratitude journal with every click.
